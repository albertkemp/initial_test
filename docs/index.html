<h2>Today's walk</h2>
<p>Today, Maya Nathan and Albert Kemp went on a walk in this super hot day. Albert tried to throw a ball at a stick but the ball missed by a few cm and went hurtling off one or so metres away. Maya started chewing on paperbark that she peeled off the tree that they both wanted to climb. Albert Kemp has had his fitness workout by hauling himself up branches of the paperbark tree. (Note: The leaves are very spiky so you shouldn't touch them, Albert got pricked by one/more of the fatal sharp points. Maya tried getting up the paperbark tree but wanted to go down every time she went up.
